# LaTeX-Code-for-Handwritten-Mathematical-Equations

A complex issue in computer vision is the recognition and processing of handwritten mathematical equations. The problem is
made even more challenging by the classification and segmentation of a single character. In this regard, several classifiers and algorithms
have been proposed for handwritten recognition. Convolutional neural networks are one of the most effective techniques for handwritten
recognition in terms of accuracy. In this project, we aim to implement a system that can take written mathematical equations as input and
after recognizing each character which includes digits and mathematical symbols convert it to the corresponding latex code. In this regard,
the performance of CNN with LeNet, will be evaluated in this project in order to classify symbols, such as digits, Latin letters, Greek
letters, and mathematical operators. Then, each symbol will be transferred to the corresponding Latex letter.
